# Rocket Boost (2.5D Precision Platformer)

#### Rocket Boost Game (2.5D Precision Platformer) 🚀
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocket Boost is a physics-based 2.5D control challenge inspired by classic arcade-style movement games.
You control a rocket that can only move along the X and Y axes. There is no depth movement — positioning and precision are everything.

#### 🎯 Objective
Launch the rocket and control it from the start platform and reach the goal platform without colliding with any obstacles, you can only touch only start and end platforms.
There are no health points, no checkpoints — one collision means GAME OVER for you. To success in this game, you have to depend entirely on:
- Controlling thrust management
- Precise rotation
- Momentum awareness
- Careful navigation through tight and dark spaces

#### 🎮 Controls
Spacebar – Apply upward rocket thrust
A / D – Rotate the rocket on Z axis, point rocket's nose to left or right.
The rocket moves in the direction its nose is pointing

#### 🧠 Core Gameplay Focus
- Physics-based movement
- Risk vs control balance
- Clean, skill-driven level design. Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Player mastery through repetition

#### 🪄 Level Challenge!
😏 There might be… an alternative way to reach the goal in some level. Try looking carefully 👀.

### This project focuses on responsive controls and momentum-based gameplay, where small input adjustments significantly impact movement.
