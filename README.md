# Rocket Boost (2.5D Precision Platformer)

#### 🚀 Rocket Boost Game
Rocket Boost is a physics-based 2.5D control challenge inspired by classic arcade-style movement games. I built this project while learning, with a focus on precision movement and level design.
You control a rocket that moves only along the X and Y axes — there is no depth movement. Positioning and precision are everything.

## 🎯 Objective
Launch the rocket from the start platform and reach the goal platform without colliding with any obstacles. The rocket can only touch the start and goal platforms.
There are no health points and no checkpoints — one collision means **GAME OVER**. To succeed, players must rely entirely on:
- Precise thrust control  
- Accurate rotation  
- Momentum awareness  
- Careful navigation through tight spaces

## 🎮 Controls
- **Spacebar** – Apply upward thrust

- **A / D** – Rotate the rocket on the Z axis

The rocket moves in the direction its nose is pointing.

## 🧠 Core Gameplay Focus
- Physics-based movement  
- Risk vs. control balance  
- Clean, skill-driven level design with increasing difficulty  
- Player mastery through repetition

## 🪄 Level Challenge
😏 There might be an alternative way to reach the goal in one of the levels. Try looking carefully 👀.
